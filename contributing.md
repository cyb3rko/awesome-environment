# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this
project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Guidelines

- Sort products / companies in categories. If a company produces products of multiple categories just add multiple entries, that's okay.
  - If a category is missing simply add it to the list or follow the [Help section](#help).
- Sort the categories AND the products / companies IN the categories alphabetically.
- The entry should look like that: `[Company Name](website) [countrycode] - Short description of the entry.`
  - The country codes can be found here: [Markdown Flag Emojis](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md#flags)
  - Example: `[An awesome product](https://the-website.com) [:de:] - This is a very cool product.`
  - The result: [An awesome product](https://the-website.com) [:de:] - This is a very cool product.

## Adding something to the list

If you have something awesome to contribute to the list, this is how you do it:

You'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)!

1. Click on the `README.md` file.
2. Now click on the edit icon (small little pen).
3. You can start editing the text of the file in the in-browser editor. Make sure you follow guidelines above. For the formatting just follow the existing entries in the list.
4. Scroll down to the bottom where it says `Commit changes`. Say why you're proposing the changes, and then click on "Propose changes".
5. Submit the [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)!

## Updating your Pull Request

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.  
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one.  
If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.

## Help

If you need help just open on [issue](https://github.com/cyb3rko/awesome-environment/issues) and I'm sure there's somebody who can help you.
